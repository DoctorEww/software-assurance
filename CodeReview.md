### Code Review

### 1. Introduction

As one of the most essential elements in Software Security Engineering, a dilligent effort must be made to verify the security of the source code used in any given 
application. To accomplish this process, engineering efforts directed at code reivew must be formulated, outlined, and executed. Code review, in general, is best accomplished via the use of both manual and automated processes.

### 2. Code Review Strategy

The code review strategy proposed will incorporate the following elements: (1) automated code scanning tools will be used to scan the BitWarden Desktop Application for known code based weaknesses, (2) autoscan results will be checked via manual review, and (3) further manual review will be carried out in identified problem areas. Some notable targets for deeper manual code scanning include: (1) input validation and sanitization processes, (2) cryptographic operations, and (3) security documentation.
