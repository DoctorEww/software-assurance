### Perceived Threats

In our selected hypothetical environment of a small IT organization that specializes in providing high quality IT PoS solutions and services to businesses nationwide there are many threats perceived by users of the software. These threats must be acknowledged to better understand how this software may be exploited and therefore inform our analysis of this software. Below is a list of potential threats perceived by users of the software in our hypothetical environment. 

- Malicious Hacker: This software may be targeted by malicious actors trying to gain access to passwords that hold payment information. Their motivation would be financial or reputation. This threat is likely looking for low hanging fruit type targets. 

- Malicious Contributor: This software is open source so an attacker could make a malicious contribution to the software to try and access the internal network of our hypothetical organization. Their motivation would be to obtain access to as many networks as possible which could leave our hypothetical organization untouched, but it could also expose a sensitive network to this malicious contributor. 

- Rogue Employee: This software may be targeted by a rogue employee who may have a computer on the network and wants to access passwords that secure financial data or other employee information. Their motivation would be financial or personal. 

- Rogue IT Staff: This software may be targeted by IT staff who may not have access to passwords securing financial data or company bank accounts, but may have admin access to computers with Bitwarden on it. Their motivation would be financial or resentment.

- Malicious Client: This software may be targeted by a client gains access to system running Bitwarden. Their motivation would likely be financial or revenge.

## Team Motivation

As we looked at the course syllabus, we focused out attention on projects that would provide our team with a good foundation for a security centered avenue of approach.  We found that there was not a perfect scenario in which our selection would be in a language we were 100% confortable with, existed with many real world uses, and not already combed through by experts to the point that there were not many issues with the program left.  With this in mind, we understood that we would have to focus on the security of a problem and find a program that allowed us to fully work through an issue and learn how the process of contributing to the open source communities worked.

After speaking with Dr. Gandhi, it was clear that as a project we should select a topic that would provide us with experience that we could use in a coorporate environment and not just for an individual user. Our primary team motive for the selection of an open source project lied in the desire to provide secure code bases for security based utilities with a coorporate minded focus.  We ended up selecting Bitwarden as the focus of our open source project because of it's core mission of providing trusted security with open source transparency and global access.

## Team Reflection

From the start, Adam Spanier was a great team lead that gathered all members of the team and ensured that information was distributed to every single person that was involved and encouraged each member which harbored a great working environment.  Initially there was an issue with communication where information was primarily sent through UNO registered emails.  Chris did not have access to that email address during that day, which hindered him from keeping in contact with the team.  The team was able to quickly adjust and add emails to the group email as well as implement a Discord for the team's discussions and Drew quickly created a GitHub repository for our team to collaborate on the project with.

Our team so far is being led very professionally by Adam, and the team is consistently providing input on what path forward to take as well as conducting the research to keep informed on what the next steps should be.  With a team that has work outside of school, scheduling was an issue that appeared early on when trying to figure out a good time to work on the project.  The team however was very flexible and quick in finding a time that worked with everyone.
