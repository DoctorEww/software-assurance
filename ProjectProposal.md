## Team Motivation - Chris

As we looked at the course syllabus, we focused out attention on projects that would provide our team with a good foundation for a security centered avenue of approach.  We found that there was not a perfect scenario in which our selection would be in a language we were 100% confortable with, existed with many real world uses, and not already combed through by experts to the point that there were not many issues with the program left.  With this in mind, we understood that we would have to focus on the security of a problem and find a program that allowed us to fully work through an issue and learn how the process of contributing to the open source communities worked.

After speaking with Dr. Gandhi, it was clear that as a project we should select a topic that would provide us with experience that we could use in a coorporate environment and not just for an individual user. Our primary team motive for the selection of an open source project lied in the desire to provide secure code bases for security based utilities with a coorporate minded focus.  We ended up selecting Bitwarden as the focus of our open source project because of it's core mission of providing trusted security with open source transparency and global access.

## Team Reflection - Chris

From the start, Adam Spanier was a great team lead that gathered all members of the team and ensured that information was distributed to every single person that was involved and encouraged each member which harbored a great working environment.  Initially there was an issue with communication where information was primarily sent through UNO registered emails.  Chris did not have access to that email address during that day, which hindered him from keeping in contact with the team.  The team was able to quickly adjust and add emails to the group email as well as implement a Discord for the team's discussions and Drew quickly created a GitHub repository for our team to collaborate on the project with.

Our team so far is being led very professionally by Adam, and the team is consistently providing input on what path forward to take as well as conducting the research to keep informed on what the next steps should be.  With a team that has work outside of school, scheduling was an issue that appeared early on when trying to figure out a good time to work on the project.  The team however was very flexible and quick in finding a time that worked with everyone.
