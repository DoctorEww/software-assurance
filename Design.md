### Observations

**1. Introduction**

In effort to best mitigate the highest impact threats, all automaitcally generated threats evaluated in review with a High priority were divided among the team and assessed for existing mitigations in the current BitWarden implementation. During individual threat review: (1) the threat is identified, (2) a justification is established, (3) existing mitigations are documented, and (4) notable gaps in identified threats and existing mitigations are highlighted.
