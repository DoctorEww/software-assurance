## Use Case: Add a Member to Group

### Description:
BitWarden allows the creation and modification of user level groups for the sharing of accounts, logins, messages, and other secure features. To expand a group, privileged users must add other BitWarden members. To ensure the security of the BitWarden group accounts, the security requirements for the group functionality must be considered.
