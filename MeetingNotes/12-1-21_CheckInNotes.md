Check In Notes

How far do we go? - If its a deep finding, go deep
How many findings? - Don’t give a report of skimming a bunch of findings
What comprises a good strategy?
How in depth will the summary need to be?

Identify at least 10 CWE’s
	Make as a checklist
	Help team divide up the work
	Each member can then focus on two of those CWE’s
		Common Weakness Enumerations

The checklist also allows us to whittle down the results of the automated tool output to focus on the CWE’s we’ve identified.
	Prioritize the output

Also helps communicate the findings very succinctly and completely.

Develop the checklist – Then once it is found, then go deep.
	Pick bugs and dive deep
	Make sure it’s a false positive
	Or a real positive and communicate with the community
	Is this a real security issue?
	Can we fix it?

CWE 20 – High level Input sanitization
	Look at children for more focused ones

CWE about cryptography.	

Steps:
    1. Choose CWE’s
    2. Let’s those guide the manual review
    3. Let those guide the automation output review
    4. Any issues that are legitimate, dive deep.
    5. Provide a report on the outcomes.
    6. For the OSS Rubric stuff: Lay out a future plan. What will we focus on in the future. Future plan on what is possible.

We can report good things as well. 
	Mention that NO code is ever executed.

Don’t always have to be findings of bad code.

Presentation
    • Convey Essence of findings, not details itself
    • Give a general overview
    • Present it as if we’re presenting it to a C level suite boardroom
    • Enough details to convince them that we used systematic processes
    • What were the key findings?
    • What are the trust decisions?
    • Make it streamlined
    • Convince the audience as to why we should or should not adopt BitWarden.
    • Hypothetical environment of operation
