Check-in Notes
10-6-2021

GOOD: Claim 4 and 5 are geared toward components
1-3 are very broad – Have a system component in mind
Claim 1 – minimize password disclosure during sync
Interested in quality of the mechanism, not the quality of the mechanism
What do we need to check to be sure it’s done correctly?
How good are the features rather than what features are implemented?

Broad claims can keep from drilling down too far

Consider adding context as to where exactly we’re going to focus
Make assurance cases as meaningful as possible for external auditors

Make these claims count – refine everything out

i.e. which transmission is the most important, which input is most important?

Claim 2 thoughts

    1. C6: What happens if an unsupported browser is used? Does it fail? Does it error?
        1. What would you like to see? 
        2. Not limited what is there
        3. This is as if we are developing it from scratch
        4. We are planning up front the verification of trustworthiness

Look at this from the viewpoint of a technical expert
Can reuse these assurance cases

A rebuttal that we don’t know how to defeat? What do we do?
A: C6 in old Claim 1 diagram: The encrypted communication avoid pattern analysis or can resist pattern analysis. Can then provide evidence in research papers or some other thing. Might have to do some extra research here, but it might be overkill. Must have a claim under the defeater. At least have an answer for the doubt.

Remember to keep the hypothetical environment in mind.
